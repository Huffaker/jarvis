Keeping the app available continuously (Windows)
  When the app is running, it asks Windows to keep the system awake so the
  server stays available. You do not need to change global sleep settings;
  when you stop the app, normal sleep behavior returns.

  To run only when plugged in (stops when unplugged):
    python run_when_plugged.py

  To also keep running with the lid closed when plugged in, set one option:
    Power Options -> Choose what closing the lid does ->
    "When plugged in" -> Do nothing.
